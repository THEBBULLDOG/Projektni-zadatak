	<h1>All of us can be hacked. Get over it</h1>
	<div class="news-1">
		<h2>Most people tend to be scared of computers. The truth is, computers are very dumb. </h2>
		<p>Ralph Echemendia can turn your laptop’s webcam on without you knowing. He can also activate its microphone to record your conversations, and would have no trouble reading your emails or eavesdropping on your phone conversations.</p>
		<p>Luckily, Echemendia is an ethical hacker: one of the good guys dedicated to educating the less computer-literate about dangers lurking in cyberspace. A world-renowned security expert, he’s helped to train Google, Microsoft and Nasa’s technical teams, and consulted on the Hollywood films Savages and Snowden, as well as the hit television series Mr Robot.</p>
		<p>Born in Cuba and raised in Miami, Echemendia was 14 when he discovered hacking. <br>
		Back then, there was no Google to look up how something works, he explains. “There was a Commodore just blinking at me, and I didn’t know what to tell it to do, or how. I read something on the BBSs called The Hacker Manifesto, written by this guy called The Mentor, and realised that was what I was. <br>
		Most people tend to be scared of computers. The truth is, computers are very dumb. They do exactly what you tell them to do, they don’t do anything else. They don’t know how to think. Even artificial intelligence is just programming.</p>
		<p>Despite his natural aptitude for computing, Echemendia chooses to hack “for the greater good” rather than hold businesses to ransom. As a “white hat” hacker who uses his specialist knowledge to seek out bugs and vulnerabilities in companies’ computer systems, he is part of an elite group whose members are among the highest-paid people in the IT industry.</p>
		<p>We all know ‘hacking’ as a term, particularly through the press, with a criminal context to it, but within our world, hacking is more about finding a way to make something do something it wasn’t intended to do,” he says. “I was able to work out very early how to break into systems legitimately, and decided to teach people how to do it. It was one way to monetise my skills without breaking any laws.</p> 
		<p>A private investigations company hired him when unreleased tracks from rapper Eminem’s 2011 album Recovery were stolen and leaked online. Echemendia spent two months following a trail of digital evidence that led him to a 16-year-old boy in Saudi Arabia who had managed to access the Gmail account of someone close to the rapper and steal the audio files.</p>
