	<h1>How do you become an ethical hacker?</h1>
	<div class="news-1">
		<h2>We examine what certifications do you need, what jobs are available and how much you can expect to be paid.</h2>
		<p>Often depicted as hooded basement-dwellers, faces lit only by blue light, hackers come in all shapes and sizes - and notably wear different coloured hats. The annoying, destruction-wielding hackers are known as black hats whereas those who use their hacking abilities for ethical, productive purposes are known as white hats.</p>
		<p>Ethical hackers are in short supply in the industry and they serve an important purpose in the overall protection of modern businesses and other organisations. The old saying ‘attack is the best form of defence’ certainly rings true in the cyber security industry, and it’s why ethical hackers are paid handsomely for their services. Their role is to use their hacking abilities and knowledge of systems to find security vulnerabilities in software and infrastructure so they can be patched before criminals can exploit them. </p>
		<p>Their work is invaluable to businesses that handle large quantities of sensitive or personally identifiable information, or those that are subject to tight regulations such as banking and financial services firms. </p>
		<p>White hats can most commonly be found working in-house at businesses or independently, either as contractors or as modern-day bounty hunters - hackers who look for security vulnerabilities in companies that offer bug bounty programmes. There are a number of large companies such as Apple and Microsoft that offer lucrative bug bounties that increase in monetary reward based on how severe the vulnerability is.</p>
		<p>There are a multitude of routes one can take to become an ethical hacker and, as previously mentioned, a number of different ways these hackers can monetise their skill set. The cyber security industry has been intent on attracting new talent to the scene and there is an abundance of resources to get you on your way to becoming a fully-fledged white hat.</p>
		<p>Before delving any deeper, it's important to clear up any misconceptions of what an ethical hacker is, rather than making judgements on what's morally right and wrong.</p>
